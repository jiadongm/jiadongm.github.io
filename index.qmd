# Statistics, biology and people

I'm a statistician working at Melbourne Integrative Genomics (MIG), the University of Melbourne. Based on my expertise in statistics and coding, I develop new computational tools to analyse big and complex 'omics' data from biomedical research. My current research program focuses on modelling complex cell states in single-cell and spatial omics data.

Curiosity is my top value. Learning new things about biology and statistics excites me. My biggest satisfaction at work comes from helping scientists and clinicians to make sense of their data. In return, they'll have to teach me biology!

I spend most of spare time parenting and reading about intellectual history (also known as history of ideas, including history of science).
