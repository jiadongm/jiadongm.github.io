    "text": "Statistics, biology and people\nI’m a computational biologist at Melbourne Integrative Genomics (MIG), the University of Melbourne. Based on my expertise in statistics and coing, I develop novel computational tools to translate big and complex biomedical data into new knowledge. My current research program is to decipher complex cell states in single-cell and spatial omics data.\nCuriosity is my top value. Learning new things about biology and statistics excites me. My biggest satisfaction at work comes from helping scientists and clinicians to make sense of their data. In return, they’ll have to teach me biology!\nI spend most of spare time parenting and reading about intellectual history (also known as history of ideas, including history of science).\n\n\nNews\n\nOur MIG Spatial Transcriptomics Data Analysis has been scheduled in August 2025. Stay tuned!\nI was invited to attend the Spatial Omics workshop in Hangzhou China in June 2025.\n\\(\\Phi\\)-space pkgdown cite is live now. Check out case studies for spatial and stem cell biology!\n\\(\\Phi\\)-space ST manuscript for spatial RNA-seq is on bioRxiv now.\n\\(\\Phi\\)-space manuscript and R package PhiSpace are online now! You can also listen to a recorded talk at this mixOmics webpage."
